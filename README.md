# Weather Dashboard App

Weather Dashboard is a pretty simple app, but it is my first app written in React.js. With this project I learned a lot about the basics of React like components, elements, props, hooks, JSX and React architecture.

The app fetches weather data from OpenWeather API, maninpulates the data, and displays it on the screen. The app is responsive and ready to be used on many different devices.

I am starting to see the advantages that React has to offer and am looking forward to building more complex projects.
